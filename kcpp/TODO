* string.c and runtime.s are a bit redundant.
Might want to actually use string.c instead of the assembly.

* Run static constructors in the start of start64
It's confusing when something like "static int X = 3;" fails because "3" was
too complicated to make a constant. OTOH, those things should rather be
constexpr and .rodata (or compile time) anyway, so maybe it's a "feature" that
this doesn't work? :D
(And some way to explicitly detect when there is initialization code?)
